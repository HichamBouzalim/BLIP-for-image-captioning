# 🖼️ BLIP with Hugging Face Transformers

This project demonstrates how to use **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining)** with Hugging Face Transformers for **image captioning** and **visual question answering (VQA)**.  

BLIP bridges the gap between **computer vision** and **natural language processing**, enabling AI systems to understand and describe images in natural language.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
By working through this project, you will learn how to:
- Understand the basics of **BLIP**
- Generate **captions for images**
- Implement **visual question answering (VQA)**
- Explore real-world applications such as accessibility, social media, and content creation

---

## 📖 Introduction

[Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) is a popular open-source library that provides state-of-the-art pretrained models for NLP and multimodal tasks.  

**BLIP** extends this by combining **text + images**, which enables:
- 📷 Automatic photo captioning
- ❓ Visual question answering
- 🔎 Image-based search queries

## ⚡ Why BLIP?
- **Enhanced Understanding** – Goes beyond object detection to interpret scenes, actions, and interactions  
- **Multimodal Learning** – Closer to how humans perceive the world  
- **Accessibility** – Generates descriptive captions for visually impaired users  
- **Content Creation** – Assists in creating descriptive text automatically
